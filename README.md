# Sorting algorithms & Big O project
Through the four tasks in this project, we learn about four different sorting algorithms and their best use case.<br/>
At the same time, we familiarise ourselves with big O notation.<br/>
## Details
__Number of tasks:__ 4<br/>
__Completed:__ N/A<br/>
### Task 0
Sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the __bubble sort__ algorithm.
### Task 1
Sorting a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the __insertion sort__ algorithm.
### Task 2
Sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the __selection sort__ algorithm.
### Task 4
Sorting an array of integers in ascending order using the __quick sort__ algorithm.
## Requirements
* Our code needs to be compiled using the `gnu89` standard and be [Betty-style](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/wiki) compliant.
* Unless stated otherwise, the `standard library` is not to be used.
* Similarly, we cannot use global variables.
* For each task, a numbered `#-O` file will contain our notations for the algorithm's time complexity:
  - In the best-case scenario
  - In the average case scenario
  - In the worst case scenario
